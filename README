PieceMaker is a small utility and library that I wrote for generating decent
looking graphical Shogi variant pieces and boards. It is descended from
an earlier implementation that I wrote in C++ and wxWidgets back in 2004.

Requirements:
   ruby 1.9
   rmagick (Tested with 2.13.1)

GitHub:
   http://github.com/jweathers/piecemk

Usage:
   The program piecemk.rb uses the library to generate boards and pieces
   for shogi variants as configured in config.yml. This file references
   individual YAML files that describe the games for which the board and
   pieces are to be generated.

   The formats for config.yml and the YAML files for shogi and chushogi
   should be fairly self-explanatory and illustrate all current possibilites.
